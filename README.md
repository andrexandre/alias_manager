# Alias manager
This script allows you to do all CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on shell alias or functions on your `.shellrc` file

It executes functions based on the shell the script was executed

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrexandre/alias_manager ; ./alias_manager/am setup
```

## Usage
- `am add ALIAS_NAME [ALIAS_COMMAND]` - create alias

- `am update` - update alias manager
